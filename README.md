ISSUES:
- GOOGLE WORKS, GITHUB WORKS, SIGNIN, SIGNUP WORKS, BUT IF YOU CHANGE THE PHOTO IT DOESN'T WORK ON

TODO LATER ON:
- add hover animations to icons
- fix profile sidebar button to go to user's profile
- change all imports to '@'
- change thread to something else univserally throughout app
- change variables and function names to something uniform
- change layout
- update UI colors
- add extra comments to other things, (but don't over do it)
- remove unnecessary and unused variables
- add images to posts (maybe videos too)
- test application by doing everything and fixing bugs in console
- see if you can implement cypress or jest
